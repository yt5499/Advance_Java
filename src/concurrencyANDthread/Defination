Concurrency:
	The system which can do more than one thing at a time. 
	
* In java, we work with the concurrency with the help of "PROCESSES & THREAD".

* Processes and Thread:
	In concurrent programming, there two basic units of execution: Processes and Threads.
	
* Process:
	- A process has a self contained execution environment. It generally has a complete, private set of basic runtime resources
	  ; in particular, each process has its own memory space.
	- Process can have multiple threads.
	
* Threads:
	- Threads are sometimes called light-weight processes(mini process). Both processes and thread provide an execution environment,
	  but creating a new thread requires fewer resources than creating new process.
	- Threads always exists within the process.
	- Threads never run in sequence, they run parallel.
