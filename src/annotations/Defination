* Annotation, a form of metadata, provide data about a program that is not a part of program itself. 
* In short, to provide short-hand metadata about the program to the java compiler.

* Syntax:
	public @interface <annotation_name>{	
	
	}
	
	Also you have to provide,
	1. When to execute this annotation(@Retention).
	2. What the annotation type is going to be applied for OR Where this annotation is going to be applied(@Target).
	
	Example:
	
		@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)		...will be executed during runtime
		@Target(ElementType.TYPE)				...will be applied to a class
		public @interface <annotation_name>{	
	
		}
